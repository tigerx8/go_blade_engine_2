# Go Blade Engine

Remove compiled file cache files already on disk (cleanup helper or endpoint).
Add a log message indicating whether a template was loaded from disk or embedded FS (useful for debugging).
Add a small test to assert go-mode Compile returns content unchanged and Blade-mode returns transformed content.
Would you like me to:

Remove existing compiled cache files automatically on startup?
Add logs showing source (disk vs embedded) when parsing templates?

Next suggestions (optional)

If you want to exclude other folders or use a whitelist instead, I can change the logic.
Add an endpoint to clear compiled cache files, or cleanup on startup (delete legacy .compiled files).
